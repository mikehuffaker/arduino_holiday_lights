This repository contains sketch code to drive an Arduino micro-controller
board attached to LED's to "blink" in different colors for different holidays.

This is a work in progress and I may still change the code and improve it
more from time to time.

Please see my website at www.huffaker.net for more detailed instructions on
how to build a full holiday lights project with an Arduino board and LED's.

Also note that although I am sharing this code as Open Source, please 
respect the BSD license terms, as stated in the LICENSE.txt file.
